# Hate-Speech-Detection-in-Multilingual-Social-Media-Text
This project develops a hate speech detection model using transformer-based architectures, **mBERT** and **XLM-R**, leveraging deep learning for multilingual context understanding. A **Streamlit web app** allows users to input text and analyze predictions. The study compares model performance on Twitter and Facebook data.
